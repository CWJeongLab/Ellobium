# Population genomic analysis of *Ellobium Chinense*
This repository contains bash command lines and scripts used in the population genomics analysis of *Ellobium Chinense* to obtain SNPs dataset, summarize sequencing statistics, calculate Fixation index, perform principal component analysis, and estimate demographic history using Multiple Sequentially Markovian Coalescent model.
In these scripts, we describe the detailed parameters used in each analysis.
The methods and software are stated in the section of Methods-Population genomic analysis and References.
